# Hotbar
A simple hotbar plugin!

Each line in the slots goes like this:

world,slot(0 is first slot),itemID:itemMeta,nameOfItem,command,executeAsPlayerOrConsole,enchant(set to "true" for enchant)

If you execute as console you can do {PLAYER} to get the player who tapped the item.

The cooldown is to "fix" the player interact spam, I recommend the default value, but you can set it as high/low as you'd like.
