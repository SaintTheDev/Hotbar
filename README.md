# Hotbar
A simple hotbar plugin! Add items and make them execute commands, on any world!
#### Configuration

The default configuration is pretty simple and is explained using comments!

It allows for unlimited commands, multiple worlds, multiple player execution, execution as op and much more!


#### Duplicate items

You can deal with duplicate items by using different lores or damage values!

Duplicate items are only an issue if on the same world!


#### Locking Inventories

You may wish to block a player from modifying the hotbar, the "Locked Inventory" part of the config allows for this:

```
Locked Inventory:
- example
- as  many as you want
- as many as you want
```

#### Cooldown
The cooldown is to "fix" the player interact spam, which is a client side bug with Windows 10, I recommend the default value, but you can set it as high/low as you'd like.
